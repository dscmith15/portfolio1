                <p>This is a copy of Edward Cokely's Berlin Numeracy Test built
                  with jsPsych. This is an assessment of risk literacy. Participants
                  receive a score from 1 to 4, where 1 is the lowest literacy
                  level and 4 is the highest. For more details, visit the the source.
                  If you would like the code for this assessment, visit the

                These data were used for proposal justification.</p>
