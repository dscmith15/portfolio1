          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          
          <p>
            Since you are 18 years of age or older, you are invited to participate 
            in a study investigating financial decision making. We hope to learn 
            more about how people make decisions when they consider risk and delay.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Participant Selection</h3>
          
          <p>
          You were selected as a possible participant in this 
          study because you fit the criteria of the population we are 
          interested in studying, namely that you are over the age of 
          18 and are currently attending WSU. You are one of at least 
          100 participants in this study.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Explanation of Procedures</h3>
          
          <p>
          If you decide to participate, you will be asked to complete an
          online survey that assesses the various ways you make financial 
          decisions. You will also be asked to answer demographics questions 
          (e.g., age, gender, income, job title), and a few questions about 
          your history with video games. The survey will take approximately 
          30 minutes to complete.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Discomfort/Risks</h3>
          
          <p>
          There are no expected risks or discomforts. However, you may 
          take a break at any time, and you may skip any questions that make
          you feel uncomfortable.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Benefits</h3>
          
          <p>
          Your participation in this study will be beneficial in helping 
          researchers better understand the key factors that contribute 
          to fiscal decisions.
          
          </p>
          
          <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
          <p>Every effort will be made to keep your study-related information 
          confidential.  However, in order to make sure the study is done 
          properly and safely there may be circumstances where this information 
          must be released. By completing this survey, you are giving the 
          research team permission to share information about you with the 
          following groups: </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Office for Human Research Protections or other federal, state, 
            or international regulatory agencies</li>
            <li>The Wichita State University Institutional Review Board</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>The researchers may publish the results of the study. If they do, 
          they will only discuss group results. Your name will not be used in 
          any publication or presentation about the study.</p>
          
          <p>
            We will work to make sure that no one sees your survey responses 
            without approval. But, because we are using the Internet, there is 
            a chance that someone could access your online responses without 
            permission. In some cases, this information could be used to 
            identify you. Your data will be protected with a code to reduce 
            the risk that other people can view the responses.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Compensation</h3>
          
          <p>For your participation, you will be awarded 2 Sona credits 
          (for psychology course students).</p>
          
          <h3>Refusal/Withdrawal</h3>
          
          <p>
          Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. Your decision
          whether or not to participate will not affect your future relations
          with Wichita State University. If you agree to participate in this
          study, you are free to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty.
