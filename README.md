This is an environment to test and tweak my dissertation stimuli on the go. The 
experiment is as follows. Participants are asked to select between two monetary
prospects. One prospect will be a guaranteed quantity and one will include a 
delay, a likelihood and a lager quantity. For each trial the, the stimuli will 
present a random combination of delay and likelihood. The participants prior 
decisions affect future prospect quantitiy amounts. For each subsequent choice 
in a condition, the amount of the smaller reward was adjusted based on the 
participant's previous choice. The size of each adjustment was half of the 
preceding adjustment. This titrating procedure helps us converge on a 
subjective value.
